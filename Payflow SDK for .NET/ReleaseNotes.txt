PayPal Payflow Gateway
PAYMENT SERVICE RELEASE NOTES
-----------------------------

***********************************************************************
*   This SDK is designed to work with both Payflow Gateway accounts   * 
*   (Payflow Pro) and Website Payments Pro accounts, including UK.    *
***********************************************************************

*** Upgrading from a Release Candidate ***
If you are upgrading from a Release Candidate, v4.0.0.9 or earlier, please 
review the notes at the bottom of this document.

*** How to use with Visual Studio 2005/2008 and .NET Framework 2.0/3.x ***
This package is designed to work with Visual Studio 2003 and .NET Framework 1.1 as the enclosed samples use the 1.1 framework by default.
 
To use this SDK with .NET Framework 2.0 or 3.x (Visual Studio 2005 or 2008) you will need to replace the payflow_dotNET.dll within the projects bin directory with the payflow_dotNET_2.0.dll (renaming it to payflow_dotNET.dll) from the root directory of the SDK.
 
Remember: Rename the file from payflow_dotNET_2.0.dll to payflow_dotNET.dll replacing the original v1.1 one.
 
Also, you will need to recompile the eStoreFront or SampleStore examples if you change the DLL from 1.1 to 2.0. 
 
*** x64 Systems ***
The payflow_dotNET_2.0.dll is the only DLL that is compiled for x64 systems.  See above.

*** Documentation ***
In addition to these Release Notes, refer to the following guides:

	1. For the API documentation, refer to "Payflow SDK for .NET API Documentation.chm" in the “docs” folder.
	2. The "Payflow SDK for .NET Developer's Guide" included in this package (Payflow SDK .NET Guide).
	3. The Payflow Pro Developer’s Guide (US, AU) or Websites Payments Pro Payflow Edition Developer's Guide (UK)
	   available from PayPal Manager at https://manager.paypal.com or from the Integration Center under 
	   Payflow Pro/Websites Payments Pro (UK) at https://www.paypal.com/IntegrationCenter/ic_home.html.

*** Using the Sample Store or eStoreFront web examples ***
Refer to either the ReadMeSampleStore.txt or ReadMeeStoreFront.txt files in the “docs” folder.

*** Debug Logging ***
For setting up logging of the SDK, refer to ReadMe.txt in the “docs” folder.

*** Common Issues ***

	1. Result code -1: Host URL is incorrect or firewall, proxy or network issue.
	2. Result code 1: Usually caused by Invalid login information (see #3) or ip restrictions on the account.
	3. Result code 26: Verify USER, VENDOR, PARTNER and PASSWORD. Remember, USER and VENDOR are both the merchant
	   login ID unless a Payflow Pro USER was created.  All fields are case-sensitive.
	4. Parser Error Message: Could not load type 'eStoreFrontVB.Global'.: You will receive this error
	   (or something similar) if you change the DLL from 1.1 to 2.0 in the eStoreFront or SampleStore 
	   examples and do not recompile your application.
	5. RegAsm error: Unable to locate input assembly: 'Payflow_dotNET.dll':  This is due to using the 1.1 version
	   of the DLL on a 64-bit OS.  Since the 1.1 DLL is for a 32-bit OS you need to copy the payflow_dotNET.dll into
	   Windows\SysWOW64 not Windows\System32 for 32-bit compatibility.  Also, can be due to not renaming the file
	   Payflow_dotNET_1.1.dll to Payflow_dotNET.dll.
	6. Receive a result code -104, Unexpected transaction state Error while parsing the xml request.  This is usually
	   due to an ampersand (&) in the XML request.  If you want to use an ampersand; such as, Bill & Ted's Auto, you 
	   need to send the data using "&amp;" to represent the ampersand.

	   For example:  <NameOnCard>Bill &amp; Ted's Auto</NameOnCard>

	  
*** Where To Begin ***
After installation of the SDK, the best place to start is to review the DoSaleComplete Console Samples which are
located under either SamplesVB or SamplesCS.  The console sample is highly commented to give you the basic idea of
how to use this SDK in your application.  The code can be used in a web application too.

For Express Checkout, use the eStoreFront web sample and for basic testing purposes you can use the console Samples,
DOSetEC, DOGetEC and DODoEC.  Again, these are for testing purposes only and to give you an insight into how to 
perform the calls; however, you would not use them in your application.  See the eStoreFront example for one way
on how you might integrate Express Checkout with your application.

REVISION HISTORY
-------------------------------
VERSION: 4.33
UPDATED: 09/21/2009
------------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES/CHANGES/UPDATES
-------------------------------------------------------
-ADDED:		Added missing Line Item parameter for NAME (L_NAME) for Express Checkout.
-FIXED:		Fixed issue where error 407 would be returned due to Proxy settings.
-ADDED:		Added the type library, payflow_dotNET.tlb, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366757(VS.85).aspx
		
		A type library (.tlb) is a binary file that stores information about a COM or DCOM object's properties and
		methods in a form that is accessible to other applications at runtime. Using a type library, an application
		or browser can determine which interfaces an object supports, and invoke an object's interface methods. 
		This can occur even if the object and client applications were written in different programming languages. 
		The COM/DCOM run-time environment can also use a type library to provide automatic cross-apartment, 
		cross-process, and cross-machine marshaling for interfaces described in type libraries.

-------------------------------
VERSION: 4.32
UPDATED: 07/01/2009
------------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES/CHANGES/UPDATES

UPDATED: 08/30/2008
------------------------------------------------------

           	which is required in production) and Reference Transactions using Express Checkout.

UPDATED: 10/25/2007
------------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES/CHANGES/UPDATES
-------------------------------------------------------

           all amounts are set to US format when sent for processing.
- FIXED:   Added missing parameter for SHIPTOSTREET2 for Express Checkout Get Response.

- UPDATED: The eStoreFront examples have been updated with minor modifications and have been tested to work on
           the PayPal Sandbox.  See the posting at https://www.paypaldeveloper.com/pdn/board/message?board.id=payflow&thread.id=660
           on how to setup your account to use the Sandbox for Express Checkout transactions.
           This has also been tested on a UK account using GBP for the currency.  However, the default currency is USD in
           the samples.

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
None

IMPORTANT NOTICE for merchants upgrading from RC3 (v4.0.0.7) or earlier:

1.	Due to the merger of PayPal and VeriSign Payment Services the Payflow Pro for .NET SDK have been
     	re-branded due to copyright issues. You will be required to modify your code to reflect these changes.
    	You can find the new naming below and in the API Docs.

2.	The SubmitCommitTransaction and Client Duration objects have been removed. They are no longer required
    	and are currently being simulated.  They will be removed in the near future and will cause older applications
    	still using them to begin to fail.
    
IMPORTANT NOTICE for merchants upgrading from RC4 (v4.0.0.9) or earlier:

1.	Moved CompanyName from the CustomerInfo class to the BillTo class.
2.	Moved MerchantDescr and MechantSvc from the CustomerInfo class to the Invoice class.
3.	Removed Payflow parameter CORPNAME.
4.  	Host URL now requires a path be set.  For example: pilot-payflowpro.verisign.com/transaction.  This requirement
    	will be removed in the future once true paypal.com URLs are created.
    
    	A result code of -1 will be returned if the path of “transaction” is not part of the Host Address.

		<!--  DYNAMIC DEBUG COMPILATION
          Set compilation debug="true" to enable ASPX debugging.  Otherwise, setting this value to
          false will improve runtime performance of this application. 
          Set compilation debug="true" to insert debugging symbols (.pdb information)
          into the compiled page. Because this creates a larger file that executes
          more slowly, you should set this value to true only when debugging and to
          false at all other times. For more information, refer to the documentation about
          debugging ASP.NET files.
    -->
		<compilation defaultLanguage="c#" debug="true" />
		<!--  CUSTOM ERROR MESSAGES
          Set customErrors mode="On" or "RemoteOnly" to enable custom error messages, "Off" to disable. 
          Add <error> tags for each of the errors you want to handle.

          "On" Always display custom (friendly) messages.
          "Off" Always display detailed ASP.NET error information.
          "RemoteOnly" Display custom (friendly) messages only to users not running 
           on the local Web server. This setting is recommended for security purposes, so 
           that you do not display application detail information to remote clients.
    -->

		<!--  AUTHENTICATION 
          This section sets the authentication policies of the application. Possible modes are "Windows", 
          "Forms", "Passport" and "None"

          "None" No authentication is performed. 
          "Windows" IIS performs authentication (Basic, Digest, or Integrated Windows) according to 
           its settings for the application. Anonymous access must be disabled in IIS. 
          "Forms" You provide a custom form (Web page) for users to enter their credentials, and then 
           you authenticate them in your application. A user credential token is stored in a cookie.
          "Passport" Authentication is performed via a centralized authentication service provided
           by Microsoft that offers a single logon and core profile services for member sites.
    -->
		<authentication mode="Windows" />
		<!--  AUTHORIZATION 
          This section sets the authorization policies of the application. You can allow or deny access
          to application resources by user or role. Wildcards: "*" mean everyone, "?" means anonymous 
          (unauthenticated) users.

		<!--  APPLICATION-LEVEL TRACE LOGGING
          Application-level tracing enables trace log output for every page within an application. 
          Set trace enabled="true" to enable application trace logging.  If pageOutput="true", the
          trace information will be displayed at the bottom of each page.  Otherwise, you can view the 
          application trace log by browsing the "trace.axd" page from your web application
          root.

		<!--  SESSION STATE SETTINGS
          By default ASP.NET uses cookies to identify which requests belong to a particular session. 
          If cookies are not available, a session can be tracked by adding a session identifier to the URL. 
          To disable cookies, set sessionState cookieless="true".

		<!-- Using the PayPal SandBox for Express Checkout:
			 
			 Before you can use the PayPal Sandbox with a Gateway account you'll need to do the following:
			 To setup a PayPal Sandbox account to work with a Payflow Pro account you will need to go to
			 https://developer.paypal.com and create an account.  Once you have access to the Sandbox then 
			 you will be able to set up test business accounts, premier accounts and personal accounts.  Please 
			 set up a test business account and personal account so you can test Express Checkout. 
			 
			 Once you have a test business account created, create a ticket at http://www.paypal.com/mts 
			 under Contact Support and request to have your Payflow Pro (US, AU) or Websites Payments Pro 
			 Payflow Edition (UK) account modified to use the PayPal Sandbox.  Provide the e-mail ID you 
			 used when you created your account on the Sandbox.
			 
			 Once you are notified that your account has been updated you will then need to modify the host 
			 URLs of the Payflow Pro Express Checkout test servers to the URLs used by the Sandbox.  
			 For example, https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_express-checkout&token=<token>.
